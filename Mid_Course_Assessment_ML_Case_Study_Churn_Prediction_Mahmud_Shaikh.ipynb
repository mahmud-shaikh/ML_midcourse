        "In this project, I analyzed a customer churn dataset to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will leave the company. I performed data preprocessing, handled categorical variables, and explored key features influencing churn. Various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were evaluated. Model performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the AUC-ROC curve to ensure robust prediction quality. The goal was to help the business identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention measures."

However, identifying customers who are likely to leave the service—known as “churn”—can be difficult without proper tools. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their profile and behavior.\n",

        "The dataset used contains information about customers such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, whether they have a credit card, if they are active members, and estimated salary. These features help us understand customer patterns and make predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By creating a classification model, we aim to help the company take early action to retain at-risk customers. The model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy and other classification metrics, with a special focus on the AUC-ROC score, which helps us understand how well the model can separate churned customers from non-churned ones. This project will not only support decision-making but also improve customer satisfaction and reduce revenue loss."
